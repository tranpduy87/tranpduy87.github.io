            <h2 class="headings heading-">History</h2>
            <p class="about-2-desc"> The International Conference on Computational Sciences and Engineering (ICCSE), formerly being held by Institute of Computational Sciences and Technology (ICST, Hochiminh city, Vietnam) emerged as a prominent platform for researchers, practitioners, and students to exchange knowledge in computational science, engineering, and interdisciplinary applications.</p>
            <p class="about-2-desc"> Founded in the early 2010s, the ICSE played a pioneering role in Vietnam’s computational science landscape. Through the ICCSE conference series, the institute nurtured scientific talent and supported the growth of computational research both nationally and in the broader Southeast Asian region.</p>
            <p class="about-2-desc"> However, the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 brought unforeseen challenges to academic exchange. In its aftermath, the ICST concluded its mission, having significantly contributed to the development of Vietnam’s scientific infrastructure and computational capacity. ICCSE, held before that period, became the final major scientific event under the ICST’s organization, symbolizing the culmination of a decade of dedicated scientific engagement.</p>
            <p class="about-2-desc"> While the ICST has since concluded its institutional operations, the legacy of ICCSE—and particularly the ICCSE-1 to ICCSE-4—continues to inspire collaborations and initiatives across computational science communities in the region.</p>
            <p class="about-2-desc"> Building on the foundation established through the series of ICCSE conferences organized by the ICST, this year, the Hochiminh City University of Technology (HCMUT), Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) jointly with VinUniversity continues to host ICCSE-5 — a prestigious academic forum that has emerged to promote professional exchange, international collaboration, and interdisciplinary research. In the current context, the HCMUT recognizes the urgent need to restart and sustain the ICCSE conference in response to three major trends: the data explosion and the demand for intelligent analytics in social, industrial, and healthcare systems; the need for innovation in medicine through computational models for effective diagnosis, treatment, and healthcare management; and global challenges such as climate change, food security, sustainable energy, and epidemic prevention, which require advanced modeling and forecasting tools.</p> 
            <p class="about-2-desc"> With this vision, ICCSE aims to build a high-quality academic forum where researchers, engineers, and students can present and discuss their latest findings; while also connecting the scientific community both domestically and internationally to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and direct the application of advanced computational techniques into practice — particularly in the fields of data science and biomedical engineering. The significance of the conference lies not only in its academic value but also in its role in bridging the younger generation of scientists with leading experts, spreading the spirit of innovation, and building a solid scientific foundation to support the sustainable development of the country amid increasing globalization and technological competition.</p>
